# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.
# Every config option has reasonable defaults unless it is labeled as "required."
# All paths are relative to the directory that Snakemake is executed in.
# Note: this file is written in the YAML syntax (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)


# A multi-sample VCF containing STRs in hg19
# The VCF must be bgzipped and a .tbi index must exist in the same directory as the VCF
# You can use HipSTR (https://github.com/HipSTR-Tool/HipSTR) to generate the VCF
# If your VCF is split by chromosome, provide the Unix-style pattern for matching them
# This input is required!
str_vcf: data/str.vcf.gz

# A multi-sample VCF containing SNPs in hg38
# The VCF must be bgzipped and a .tbi index must exist in the same directory as the VCF
# The samples in this VCF must match those in the STR VCF _exactly_ (ie same ordering)
# If your VCF is split by chromosome, provide the Unix-style pattern for matching them
# This input is required!
snp_vcf: data/snp.vcf.gz

# Which samples from the VCF should we execute the pipeline on?
# Comment out this line or set it to a falsey value if you want to use all of the
# samples in the VCF
# TODO; this option hasn't been implemented yet, so anything here will be ignored
SAMP_NAMES: []

# Path to the hg38 reference genome
# Must be properly indexed
# This input is required!
ref_genome: data/hg19.chr2.fa

# If the variants in the VCF are unphased, provide the path to our SNP+STR reference
# haplotype panel for phasing
# Provide the path to a directory containing all of the chr*.vcf.gz files from here:
# http://gymreklab.com/2018/03/05/snpstr_imputation.html
# If this option is a falsey value, the pipeline will assume all sample VCFs are phased
