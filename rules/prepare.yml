# This is a Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the prepare pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the "prepare" Snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the prepare.smk file requires it.
# Every config option is required unless it is labeled otherwise.
# All paths are relative to the directory that Snakemake is executed in.
# Note: this file is written in the YAML syntax (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)
